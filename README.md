### Overview

This project is a close‑to‑real‑time manufacturing compliance automation system powered by **TwelveLabs video intelligence**. It enables video upload, AI-powered semantic search, compliance analysis, and reporting through an intuitive frontend interface.

The application includes **full Japanese language localization** powered by **SambaNova's Llama-3.3-Swallow-70B-Instruct model**, enabling seamless English ↔ Japanese translation of both static UI elements and dynamic AI-generated content.

### Key Features

- 🎬 **Actionable video analytics** with TwelveLabs Marengo and Pegasus models
- 🤖 **Agent chatbot** for video Q&A and insights
- 📊 **Instant compliance report creator** (per shift/factory)
- 📡 **Live stream simulation** via RTSP worker with HLS playback
- 🎬 **Video chaptering**, event timeline, and clip generation
- 🔍 **Semantic video search** powered by TwelveLabs Marengo
- 🌐 **Japanese localization** via SambaNova Swallow model

### Japanese Localization (i18n)

This project demonstrates real-time Japanese language support for industrial video AI applications:

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Static UI Text | Pre-translated dictionary with 150+ strings |
| Dynamic Content | SambaNova Llama-3.3-Swallow-70B-Instruct |
| State Management | React Context with localStorage persistence |
| Translation API | Next.js API route at `/api/translate` |

Users can toggle between English (🇺🇸) and Japanese (🇯🇵) at any time. All AI-generated compliance reports, chat responses, and video analysis summaries are translated on-demand.

### Repository Structure

- `frontend/`: Next.js app for search, analytics, reporting UI, and Japanese localization
- `rtsp-stream-worker/`: FastAPI + MediaMTX worker for RTSP/HLS, chunking, and video uploads
- `cv_model/`: PPE detection training scripts and training results
- `assets/`: Images and diagrams (e.g., `architecture.png`)

### Getting Started (High‑Level)

1) See `frontend/README.md` to configure environment variables (including SambaNova API key) and run the UI.
2) See `rtsp-stream-worker/README.md` to run the worker (Docker) and enable live streams and processing.
3) See `cv_model/README.md` for background on PPE model training and results.

### Notes on Credentials

Environment variables are required for AWS, TwelveLabs, and SambaNova endpoints. Place them in the respective `.env` files as described in sub‑module READMEs. Treat any shared keys as development‑only and rotate for production.
